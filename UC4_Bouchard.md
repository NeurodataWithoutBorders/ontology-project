# Use Case 4 - Coordinated Movements (Bouchard Lab)

## Key Personnel/Points of Contact

* Brian Gereke
* Kristian Bouchard


## Metadata Focus Areas

### Task: 

Brian has just started at the lab, and so he is still speccing out his
task. We spoke with him at his poster at SfN, he is collecting a lot
fo video data and analyzing reaching and grasping and his main concern
is with compressing this data down and capturing provenance/metadata
for his analyses. 


### Stimulus

* ...


### Registration of spatial coordinates

* ...


### Genotype/strain metadata

* Rat strains, optogenetic tools
   


## Questions/Next steps

* Brian mentioned the Whishaw lab in Lethbridge (string-pulling task)
has a 'taxonomy' of reach/grasp types that might be useful for us to
characterize these types of task?
