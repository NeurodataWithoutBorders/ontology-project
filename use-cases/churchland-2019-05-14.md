## Overview Description

James analyzes and model data from 2-photon calcium or wide field imaging data of perception decision experiments. The experiment is a two-alternative forced choice task where the mouse is presented with either an auditory, visual or tactile stimulus and the subject will either lick left or right to receive a water reward.

Transgenic mice are used requiring an injection to activate cells of interest.

The choice is based on the frequency of the tone, light or vibration stimulus. If the stimulus is less than 12Hz, the mouse should lick left and lick right if greater than 12Hz.

For the vibration stimulus, the mouse grasp two handles which vibrates at a specified frequency.

Widefield image is done initially to generate a retonotopic map to guide the location on primary visual area in the cranial window.

Histology of mouse brain slices is sometimes done by not routinely.

Widefield image data can be registered to top-down view of the CCF by a systematic automated way (details not discussed).
