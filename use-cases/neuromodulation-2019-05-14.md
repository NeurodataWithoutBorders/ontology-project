Lingling Yang (yang7003@umn.edu)

## Overview Description

Lingling is performing analysis of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treatment of Parkinson disease in monkey models. 

Subject are either normal, mild or moderate conditions and are undergoing DBS, Lodapa and no therapeutic treatment. Probes are inserted into one or two areas (cortical or subcortical) of the brain for DBS. Neural data is captured using an electrode array.

UPDRS motor score testing is performed to determine if there is any improvement of the movement as a result of the therapy.

The subject performs several tasks:
-	Touch 
--	Subject touches a touch pad
-- Location and timing of the touch is recorded
-	Reaching
-- Subject reaches into a box to obtain a treat
-- A video is recorded from which location, location and direction can be derived to annotate, start to reach, reaching, end of reaching
-	Walking
-- Subject walks across a mat
-- Gait pressure mat data can be used to record the location and timing of footfall
